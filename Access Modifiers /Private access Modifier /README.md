# Student Details Program in Java

This program showcases the usage of encapsulation in Java by implementing a `Student` class with private data members and providing access to them using getters, setters, and member functions.

### `Student` Class:

The `Student` class encapsulates student details with private data members:

- `id` (int): Student ID
- `name` (String): Student Name
- `age` (int): Student Age

#### Getters and Setters:

- `getId()`: Retrieves the student ID.
- `setId()`: Sets the student ID.
- `getName()`: Retrieves the student name.
- `setName()`: Sets the student name.
- `getAge()`: Retrieves the student age.
- `setAge()`: Sets the student age.

#### Member Function:

- `displayDetails()`: Displays the student details.

### `MainClass`:

The `MainClass` contains the `main` method to interact with the `Student` class:

- It creates an instance of the `Student` class.
- Prompts the user to input student details (ID, Name, Age).
- Utilizes setters to set the student details.
- Displays the student details using the `displayDetails()` function.

### Example Usage:

```java
public class Student {
    // ... (Student class details as provided in the previous code snippet)
}

public class MainClass {
    // ... (Main method to interact with the Student class)
}
