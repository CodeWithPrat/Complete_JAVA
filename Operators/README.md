# Operators 

## Description
Operators in programming languages are symbols or characters that perform specific operations on one or more operands (variables, constants, or expressions). They are fundamental components used to manipulate data and perform computations within a program.

### Types of Operators
* Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (** or ^ in some languages).
* Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. For example, = (simple assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *= (multiplication assignment), /= (division assignment), and more.
* Comparison or Relational Operators: Used to compare values and return a boolean result. Common comparison operators include == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to).
* Logical Operators: Used to perform logical operations on boolean values. These include && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).
* Bitwise Operators: Manipulate individual bits within binary representations of data. Examples include &, |, ^ (bitwise AND, OR, XOR), ~ (bitwise NOT), << (left shift), and >> (right shift).
* Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand. Examples include ++ (increment), -- (decrement), + (unary plus), - (unary minus), ! (logical NOT), and ~ (bitwise NOT).
* Ternary Operator: Often represented as ? :, it's a conditional operator that evaluates a boolean expression and returns one of two values based on the result of the evaluation.
* String Concatenation Operator: Joins two strings together. For example, in many languages, the + operator is used for string concatenation.
